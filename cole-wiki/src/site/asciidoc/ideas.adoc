= Ideas

This is a page with ideas for the cole language, it is pretty much unstructured, since at first it will be a
dumping ground for stuff I like in other languagesâ€¦

It is organized by subpages grouped by languages. Currently there are the following:

* link:./ideas/python.html[Python];
* link:./ideas/rust.html[Rust];
* link:./ideas/haxe.html[Haxe];
* link:./ideas/crystal.html[Crystal];
* link:./ideas/ruby.html[Ruby];
* link:./ideas/c-sharp.html[C-Sharp];
* link:./ideas/golang.html[GoLang];
