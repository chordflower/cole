= C#

These are the features being considered for cole based on C#.

== Partial Types

To allow classes to be partially defined, perhaps as a mechanism to reduce long
inheritance chains, particularly with auto-generated code…

[source,C#]
----
public partial class MyClass {
    //...
}
----

== Null coalescing operator

This operator has the form of:

[source,C#]
----
a = b ?? 'a';
----

And allows to specify a default value, in case of b being null.

== Anonymous function

In computer programming, an anonymous function (function literal, lambda abstraction
, or lambda expression) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier.
Anonymous functions are often arguments being passed to higher-order functions, or
used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to return
a function. If the function is only used once, or a limited number of times, an
anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function. Anonymous
functions are ubiquitous in functional programming languages and other languages with
first-class functions, where they fulfil the same role for the function type as literals
do for other data types. 

[source,C#]
----
// the first int is the x' type
// the second int is the return type
// <see href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549151.aspx" />
Func<int,int> foo = x => x * x;
Console.WriteLine(foo(7));
----

=== Properties

This will alow to replace the barrage of getter/setter in other languages…

[source,C#]
----
property MyProperty {
  get {
    return 3;
  }
  set {
    //self.val = value;
  }
}
----

== Object and Collection Initializers

I'm in love with this C# feature, it allows to initialize classes like this:

[source,C#]
----
MyType type = new MyType {
  Id: 3,
  Age: 20,
};
----

It is awesome…

== Named Arguments and Optional Parameters

____

In another addition to C#, methods now support optional parameters with default
values so that when you call such a method you can omit those parameters.

____

[source,C#]
----
class Car {
  public void Accelerate(
    double speed, int? gear = null, 
    bool inReverse = false) { 
    /* ... */ 
  }
}
----

____

C# 4.0 will also let you call methods by specifying some arguments by name. In
this way, you can pass an argument to an optional parameter without having to also
pass arguments for all the parameters that come before it.

____

[source,C#]
----
myCar.Accelerate(55, inReverse: true);
----

== Async/Await functions

In computer programming, the async/await pattern is a syntactic feature of many
programming languages that allows an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be
structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. It is semantically
related to the concept of a coroutine and is often implemented using similar techniques,
and is primarily intended to provide opportunities for the program to execute other
code while waiting for a long-running, asynchronous task to complete, usually represented
by promises or similar data structures.

[source,C#]
----
public async Task<int> SumPageSizesAsync(IList<Uri> uris) 
{
    int total = 0;
    foreach (var uri in uris) {
        statusText.Text = string.Format("Found {0} bytes ...", total);
        var data = await new WebClient().DownloadDataTaskAsync(uri);
        total += data.Length;
    }
    statusText.Text = string.Format("Found {0} bytes total", total);
    return total;
}
----

== Safe navigation operator

In object-oriented programming, the safe navigation operator (also known as optional
chaining operator, safe call operator, null-conditional operator) is a binary operator
that returns null if its first argument is null; otherwise it performs a dereferencing
operation as specified by the second argument (typically an object member access or an
array index). 

[source,C#]
----
var name = article?.Author?.Name;
----

== String interpolation

That is the ability to use local variables in string values without, the hassle of:

----
String out = "The value of " + val.name + " is " + val.value;
----

And instead something like:

[source,C#]
----
String out = $"The value of {val.name} is {val.value}";
----

But perhaps with the following syntax:

----
String out = "The value of ${val.name} is ${val.value}";
----

Meaning that all strings can be interpolated…

== nameof operator

This is a short version of:

----
String out = val.class.getName();
----

That in C# is:

[source,C#]
----
String out = nameof(val);
----

== Deconstruction

That is the ability for something like this:

[source,C#]
----
var (name, age) = new Person("John Doe", 30);
----

Where in this case name is "John Doe" and age is 30.

== Digit Separator

The ability to use &quot;_&quot; as a digit separator, allowing something like this:

[source,C#]
----
long num3 = 1_000_000_000_000;
----

== Binary Literals

The ability to specify numbers in binary form:

[source,C#]
----
var num = 0b10001;
----

== Switch Expressions

The ability for switches to be assigned as a return value or to a variable.

[source,C#]
----
public static class SwitchExample {
    public enum Directions {
        Up,
        Down,
        Right,
        Left,
    };

    public enum Orientation {
        North,
        South,
        East,
        West,
    };

    public static void Main() {
        var direction = Directions.Right;
        Console.WriteLine($"Map view direction is {direction}");

        var orientation = direction switch {
            Directions.Up    => Orientation.North,
            Directions.Right => Orientation.East,
            Directions.Down  => Orientation.South,
            Directions.Left  => Orientation.West,
        };
        Console.WriteLine($"Cardinal orientation is {orientation}");
    }
}
